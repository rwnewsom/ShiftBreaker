# shiftBreaker

## this project began as an attempt to improve an earlier exercise - the ubiquitous 'Caesar Shift' cipher.  

It currently functions as a poly-alphabetic or 'Vigenere Cipher.'

Given a plaintext message and a keyword, it will rotate through each letter of message and encrypt by likewise rotating through the keyword.

The longer the keyword is relative to the message, the more secure the encrypted message will be.

The next milestone for this project is to - given an encrypted message - conduct frequency analysis and attempt to decrypt.
